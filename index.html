        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
            There are terrorists trying to bomb the city, you are the only soldier <br> 
            in city so it is your job to stop them. Defeat all terrorists before they kill you. <br>
            Be alert, terrorists spawn anywhwere and they shoot you. <br>
            You have only 3 lives, everytime they shoot you, your life decreases. <br>
            You have a limited ammo of 12 bullets. <br>
            The game will be over if you exhaust your ammo or use all lives. <br> 
            The only way to win is by defeating all terrorists.
         </p>

         <h2>Instructions:</h2>
         <p>
             Press 'S' to start the game. <br>
             After the game finishes press 'R' to restart.<br>
             Use the up, down, right and left arrow keys to move in that particular direction. <br>
             Press the spacebar to shoot one bullet at a time. <br>
        </p>

        <hr color=black>

        <h2>Libraries used:</h2>
        <p>
            p5.js and p5.play.js <br>
            <br>
            Libraries are files where developers collect pre-written code and <br>
            functions which can later be used by a programmer.
        </p>

        <h2>Tools used:</h2>
        <p>
            All objects in the game are made using sprites. <br>
            Sprites are used where you need to add images or animations to objects. <br>
            They don't obey the laws of physics.
        </p>

        <h2>Explaining the code:</h2>

        <a></a><img src="key83.PNG"/></a>
        <p>
            83 is the value given to 'S', so when 'S' key is pressed, the game will go to gameState 1 which is the play state,
            and a sound is played. <br>
            In play state a background image is added and enemyShoot and spawnEnemy functions are called. <br>
            The if conditions contain movements for the Soldier. <br>
            spawnEnemy creates a terrorist sprite, spawns them randomly and adds images randomly.
        </p>

        <a></a><img src="enemy.PNG"/></a>
        <p>
            Here bullets for the terrorist are created. <br>
            enemyShoot is the function which makes the terrorist automatically shoot us. <br>
            Because there are multiple bullets, they are added in to group.
        </p>

        <a></a><img src="player.PNG"/></a>
        <p>
            Here bullets for the Soldier are created. <br>
        </p>

        <a></a><img src="keypress.PNG"/></a>
        <p>
            32 is the value for the spacebar. <br>
            spawnBullets is called when spacebar is pressed, ammo is decremented and a sound is played. <br>
            Bullets are only shot when game is in play state (gameState=1).
        </p>

        <a></a><img src="end.PNG"/></a>
        <p>
            The game only ends when any one of these conditions is true. <br>
            The conditons are:  <br>
            life=0 (meaning all lives are used) <br>
            ammo=0 (meaning all bullets are used) <br>
            kills=10 (meaning all terrorists have been defeated)
        </p>
